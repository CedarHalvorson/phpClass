# phpClass
Lets see if we can create a list of students.


IDEA: You’re a school administrator and you want to create a tool to add students to a list of enrolled students.

GOALS:

Create list page to display all enrolled students
Create a page to add new students
Create a class to represent a student
Create a class to manipulate students (only method initially will be to add a new student)
Use $_POST array to verify new student information being added is allowed
Added students should show up on the list page
When echoing a PHP variable onto the page, make sure to escape it.
Use a local JSON file as a database to store enrolled students. Use PHP file functions to store and gather the info. 
Use GitHub


	TIPS:

I didn’t give you much because searching, reading, and picking how to do something will help you learn rather than pasting things I give you. Google it. Stack Overflow is your friend. Don’t know how to use a JSON file as a local database? Google “php read and write to json file”.
I don’t care about how things look. You can skip css at this point in time.


	STUDENT INFO (declare property types as you see fit, i.e. string, int, float, array, etc.):


First name - Required & limit of 15 characters
Last Name - Required & limit of 15 characters
Age - Required & limit of 2 characters
Time of enrollment - Required & in format 2022-01-24 13:23:11
Top three academia categories (math, science, etc.) - Required
Short Description of appearance - Optional & limit of 300 characters





	P.S. We'll build on this but this is a good start.
